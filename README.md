Input needed version (for version.xml) generating, folder with your files and folder for output result, and then just press "Start".
Folder for files should emulate Gothic 2 game folder, it is simillar to GothicVDFS tool. If you want launcher to download your Addon.vdf to **Gothic 2/Data** folder, then you
should create **Data/** folder in your "In" directory and and put your files there.

Output folder will contain files.xml and version.xml, that you need to copy to your remote server, and the **files** folder, that contains copies of your files, just without the subfolders. 
That's the format how this files should uploaded to your remote server. Essentialy, you can just copy all the content of your "Out" folder and just bring it to your remote server.
